# Homework-01
## Using semantics to simplify an HTML 
### **Changes made** ðŸ’«
* Changed the ID called header and the respective "div" into "header."
    * In the header section of the styling sheet I made sure that each selector was precise in showing what section it was picking. For example, in "header ul" I added nav, so as to show that I intended to include the nav tag.
    * Subsequently, took out any div in the CSS style page within the header and turned ".header" into "header."
* In the main portion of the site, I changed the tag to "article"
    * Subsequently changed description of each div inside the article to "section"

* Changed side menu to "aside"
    * In this portion, I consolidated each "benefit" subsection - this was to simplify the sytling of all of those sections since they all had the same styling. I did this by giving all three sections a class of "article content"
    * Now that all three sections have the same class I was able to consolidate them in the styling sheet. This worked for the headers of each section as well.
    * I added an ID that separated each section - this was not used in the styling sheet, it was only to differentiate the sections.

* Added footer tag
    * In the footer tag, I changed the H4 to H2

## Here is the result!
